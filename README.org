Sketch of an experiment to create a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation][Discrete-event simulation]] package
based on [[https://juliagizmos.github.io/Observables.jl/stable/][Observables.jl]]. This is in contrast to [[https://github.com/BenLauwens/SimJulia.jl][SimJulia.jl]], which
is based on [[https://github.com/BenLauwens/ResumableFunctions.jl][ResumableFunctions.jl]]. Reasons for this experiment
include:

- ResumableFunctions.jl is difficult to debug when errors are thrown.
- The API of SimJulia.jl has some rough edges that surprised me on
  first use.
- By basing the package on something less esoteric than
  ResumableFunctions.jl, better interop may be maintained with the
  rest of the Julia package ecosystem.

** TODO Status

- [X] Implement a doubly-linked list for the calendar
- [ ] Functions/macros for scheduling an event
- [ ] Run a simulation
- [ ] Types representing scarce resources
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Register in [[https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General/][General registry]].
- [ ] Benchmark against [[https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/LinkedLists.jl][LinkedLists.jl]].
  - [ ] If benchmarks are favorable, consider splitting my linked list
    implementation into its own package or contributing the
    implementation to LinkedLists.jl.
